# UX Requirements Document for Simple To-do App

## Overview

The purpose of this document is to outline the UX and design requirements for a native mobile To-do app. The app aims to provide a straightforward and intuitive task management experience to help users keep track of their daily tasks and priorities. The design will be delivered in the form of a Figma prototype, showcasing the app's user interface and interactions.

## Target Platforms

The app will be developed for the following native mobile platforms:

1. iOS
2. Android

Although we are targeting two platforms, we prefer to have a unified design across both platforms.  Please take into account that UX features and UI design should not distract from a user's platform.

## User Goals

The primary user goals for the app are:

1. Add new tasks quickly and easily.
2. View, edit, and delete existing tasks effortlessly.
3. Organize tasks into different categories or lists.
4. Mark tasks as complete and track their progress.
5. Set reminders and due dates for tasks.
6. Maintain a clean and clutter-free user interface.

## Design Guidelines

1. **Minimalist Design**: The app should embrace a minimalist design philosophy, focusing on essential elements and removing any unnecessary clutter. Utilize ample white space to create a visually appealing and uncluttered interface.

2. **Intuitive Navigation**: Ensure a simple and intuitive navigation flow. Users should be able to access all core functionalities without any confusion.

3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in terms of typography, color schemes, and iconography across the app to create a cohesive and unified user experience.

4. **Visual Feedback**: Provide clear visual feedback for user actions, such as task completion, deletion, and adding new tasks, to confirm that their interactions were successful.

5. **Accessibility**: Design the app with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it is usable by individuals with different abilities. Consider appropriate color contrast, font sizes, and accessibility features for both platforms.

6. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: While adhering to platform-specific design guidelines, strive for a consistent user experience across both iOS and Android platforms.

## Figma Prototype

The Figma prototype should consist of the following screens and interactions:

1. **Login Screen**: This is the first screen of the app.  It should allow users to login with their email and password.  Creating an account is not required at this time.

2. **Home Screen**: This is the main screen where users can view their To-do list. It should display a list of tasks, their state, their categories, and their due date; each with an option to mark as complete and delete. Include a prominent button to add a new task at the bottom of the list. This screen should also allow for sorting by task name alphabetically, by due date, and by date added.

3. **Task Details Screen**: When a user taps on a task, a details screen should appear, allowing them to view and edit task details, set due dates, and add notes.

4. **Task Creation Screen**: This screen should allow users to create a new task by entering the task name, setting due dates (if required), and choosing a list/category for the task.

5. **Category/List Management Screen**: Include a screen where users can manage different categories/lists, add new ones, or delete existing ones.

6. **Empty States**: Include designs for empty states, such as when the task list is empty or when there are no categories/lists.

## Interactive Elements

Ensure the Figma prototype showcases the following interactive elements:

1. **Navigation**: Show transitions between screens to demonstrate navigation flow.

2. **Button Interactions**: Display button states (normal, hover, pressed) to provide feedback to users during interactions.

3. **Form Inputs**: Demonstrate how form inputs (text fields, date pickers) function and respond to user input.

4. **Task Interactions**: Illustrate interactions when marking a task as complete or deleting a task.

5. **Category/List Management**: Visualize how users can add or delete categories/lists.

## Conclusion

The UX requirements outlined in this document aim to create a simple and intuitive To-do app that meets user needs and provides a delightful experience. By delivering the design in the form of a Figma prototype, the development team can effectively understand and implement the desired user experience, resulting in a successful and user-friendly mobile application.
